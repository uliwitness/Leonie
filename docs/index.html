<h3>What is Stacksmith?</h3>
<p><a href="https://stacksmith.org/">Stacksmith</a> is an app that lets you make your own apps, easily, by using a
program that thinks like a human, not like a programmer. Leonie is an internal detail of how Stacksmith works, and users should
never have to deal with it directly, or even know it is there.</p>
<p>For advanced users, we might eventually offer the option to remove all clear-text scripts from their final app and
instead only include the Leonie bytecode they compile to, thus decreasing startup overhead a little and making it slightly
arder to read what their app does internally than just opening a text file.</p>
<h3>What is leonie?</h3>
<p>Leonie is the "virtual machine" that Stacksmith's "Forge" programming language uses to run its programs.</p>
<p>Think of Leonie as a "virtual CPU". All your Forge scripts get compiled into instructions this CPU understands,
and only the C code that implements this virtual CPU needs to be ported to another platform. Also, by compiling your
scripts to virtual instructions like that, your loops do not waste time repeatedly reading the text of each command and variable name.
